## About

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority.
This Tableau case study aims to investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates.
Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn.
Investigating churn rate is done by answering questions by creating calculated fields and various visualizations in Tableau, such as dual-axis graphs and scatter plots making graphs dynamic 
by using filters and parameters, and combining everything into a story to share insights.
