## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

Project aims to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website where goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Final Concolusions & Recommendations

1. Using the A/B testing method, we failed to reject the Null hypothesis
2. Using the Regression method, we found that countries don't have a significant impact on conversion
3. Newer pages may have higher ratings due to the Novelty effect
4. It is better to start launching a newer page rather than keep testing the new page we analyzed
