## Background
Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects Portifolio!

My name is Khaled Hassan a Mechatronics Engineer gradute, with a specific major of Bio-mechatronics which aims to study prothestetics & relating it with smart technologies & tools aiming to target disabled paitents having a smart prothestetics to live a normal life.
My study was all about learning how to build & maintain fill mechatronic system (Mechanical, Electrical & Programming) where I exposed to build many projects during study relating to all of these 3 sections (Eg: Making small-scale full production line using sensors, actuators & microcontrollers)

My Graduation Project was a Brain Machine Interface (BCI) system which aims to help fully-paralyzed paitents in upper-part to use their brains signal moving a robotic arm in 4 main directions (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT) + STOP, assisting them in their daily tasks. My role was to contribute in a pyton code, classifing brain signals to 5 classes using ML models & preprocessing techniques.

Now, I focus on programming & dealing with BI tools conducting analysis on topics that interest me in Data Sceince & Data Analysis field!
